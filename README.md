# World Energy Consumption - project
Analysis of the following dataset: 'World Energy Consumption', which presents the characteristics of energy consumption and production by countries.
<br/>
<br/>
For further analysis, downloaded csv file was transformed using MS Excel (Power Query). Steps taken:
- Drop the columns (The remaining ones: iso_code, country, year, population, gdp, electricty_generation, coal_electricity, oil_electricity, gas_electricity, nuclear_electricity, biofuel_electricity, hydro_electricity, solar_electricity, wind_electricity)
- Reordering columns
- Change of the following columns format to number: year, population, gdp
- Filtering the columns (only data for the years 2000-2010)

The transformed data was then used in analysis using SQL.
<br/>
<br/>

Main conclusions:
- Pacific Asia's domination in context of world electricity production (about 38 % of total in 2010)
- High electricity dependence on renewable sources in such countries as:  Bhutan, Brazil and Albania (in this case, acoording to the given data, 99,97 % of total electricity came from hydropower plants in 2010)
- Average of 37 000 kWh of electricity per capita in Iceland
